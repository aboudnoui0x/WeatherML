About WeatherML

WeatherML is an advanced machine learning application that predicts weather conditions using Logistic Regression. Our model is trained on thousands of weather patterns to provide accurate predictions.

The model analyzes three key weather parameters: temperature, humidity, and wind speed to determine whether conditions will be sunny or rainy with high confidence.  

Developed by Team AbdAllah Noui, Megueddem Yacine, and KHADRAOUI AYA
